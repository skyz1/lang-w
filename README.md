# LangW

A website for playing with the simple programming language LangW.

I made this project to learn react and to better understand programming languages and the inner workings of compilers.

You can try out the project [here](https://skyz1.github.io/lang-w/).

## Project Setup
Clone the project from github:
```
git clone git@github.com:skyz1/lang-w.git
```
Install all dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run the app in the development mode:
```
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
